# What on earth is this thing???
This is the easiest way to install the software that powers Mazopolis Multiplayer.

# How
After you have installed it, run
`mzr`
It will ask you questions and ask you to set it up.
After, you're done!
Make sure to get an ssl certificate from https://letsencrypt.org (or any other place, but Let's Encrypt is free) and plop it inside of the ssl-cert folder.

## When will this be supported on Mazopolis.com?
Very soon. :)
We are still working on the software though, so it's not ready for release **yet**, so stay tuned!
Update 10/23/19:
maybe some day, but not anytime soon.

# Notice
This is my first ever NPM package. If I did anything wrong, tell me on GitHub here:
