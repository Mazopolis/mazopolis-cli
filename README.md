# What on earth is this thing???
This is the easiest way to install the software that powers Mazopolis Multiplayer.

# How
After you have installed it, run
`mzr`
It will ask you questions and ask you to set it up.
After, you're done!
Make sure to get an ssl certificate from Let's Encrypt and plop it inside of the ssl-cert folder.

## When will this be supported on Mazopolis.com?
Very soon. :)

# Notice
This is my first ever NPM package. If I did anything wrong, tell me on GitHub here:
